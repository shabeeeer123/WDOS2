		<h3>FLYING RAVANA - ELLA </h3>
	<span class="image image-full"><img src="Images/activities 1.jpg" width= "1300" height="500" alt="" /></span> <p>Zip lining is an action-filled recreational activity that involves riding a steel cable on a protective seat or a belt between two points and generally on a valley that exhibits spectacular sceneries.
    		The incline of a zipline allows the rider to be pulled by gravity along the line. Today, ziplines are mainly used for recreation such as eco-tours. 
            If you're doing a canopy tour with friends or family members, ziplining has a way of bonding people through a fun, shared experience. There's usually lots of joking around, encouragement or, at worst, a little bit of shared nervous energy before that first zipline run.</p>

			<h3>KNUCKLES MOUNTAIN RANGE - KANDY</h3>
	<span class="image image-full"><img src="Images/activities 2.jpg" width= "1300" height="500" alt="" /></span> <p>Hiking is an activity of moderate difficulty, which involves walking across long distances generally on trails or paths. The duration of the activity varies between short half-day programs and longer itineraries of over 20 days. It is usually an activity that allows groups of different sizes. 
			Going for a hike reduces your blood pressure and cortisol levels producing a calming effect only nature can offer - over an above the benefits of exercise alone. 
			It can also be easy and fun. Some people love to hike because they love to spend time in nature. Others are after the adrenaline rush and physical challenge of a high ridge. Hiking is such a broad activity. </p>
		
		
		<p>The Knuckles Mountain Range lies in central Sri Lanka, in the Districts of Matale and Kandy. The range takes its name from a series of recumbent folds and peaks in the west of the massif which resemble the knuckles of clenched fist when viewed from certain locations in the Kandy District.
        Named after its uncanny likeness to human knuckles, the Knuckles Mountain Range is a gorgeous UNESCO World Heritage Site and a popular spot for hikers. The dense forest, surrounded by 34 mystical mountains that range from 900 to 2,000 metres, is home to stunning hiking trails.
        There are nine peaks over 1200 meters (4000 ft) in Knuckles Range. The highest peak, "Gombaniya" is 1906 meters (6248 Ft).

		<h3>BORDERLANDS - KITULGALA</h3>
    	<span class="image image-full"><img src="Images/activities 3.jpg" width= "1300" height="500" alt="" /></span> <p>Rafting and whitewater rafting are recreational outdoor activities which use an inflatable raft to navigate a river or other body of water. This is often done on whitewater or different degrees of rough water. Dealing with risk is often a part of the experience 
			White Water Rafting is a challenging recreational activity and an exhilarating water sport. Yet contrary to the public belief, White Water Rafting is not a sport that demands great physical strength. 
			White Water Rafting, generally enjoyed in the white-waters as well as in other turbulent waters, brings about an enthralling experience to the water sport enthusiasts. </p>
		
		<p>After coming off the slopes of Adam’s Peak, the clear waters of the Kelani Riverwind their way through the Hill Country of inland Sri Lanka before emptying into the Indian Ocean. The put in for rafting is just upstream from Kithulgala, a small town in the tea country. After a safety briefing and a few pointers on rafting technique, we’ll jump right into the action. Seven high quality, class II and III rapids and temperate waters make the Kelani a premier introduction to the sport of whitewater or an exciting choice for experienced rafters. The river hosts rapids between grades 2 and 3, with the rafting stretch approximately 6.5 kilometers in length, and taking between 45 minutes to 1.5 hours to complete, depending on water levels. With the Kelani’s special “Killer Fall” and “Butter Crunch” rapids, rafters are guaranteed a challenge, but are also offered a chance to relax, with small calm stretches allowing a refreshing swim in the river to unwind. Ideal times are from May to December, although there 
        are no “bad” times. The river is dam controlled. Therefore, water levels can be low in April, but can also be quite high during the monsoon season.
        River Grade Rafting Time Kithulgala / Kelani River 2 – 3 rapids 2 hrs Sitawaka 3 – 4 rapids 2-2.5 hrs Mahaweli 3 – 5 rapids 3-3.5 hrs.
