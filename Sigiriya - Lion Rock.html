          <p class="info"> What is Sigiriya ?  
          <p>Sigiriya is an ancient rock fortress and palace built by King Kashyapa during the reign of 473 – 495 which is standing majestically 660 feet straight up. It is located in the northern Matale district near the town of Dambulla in central province of Sri Lanka. The word Sigiriya or the Sinhagiri means the Lion’s Rock where you have to climb up 1200 steps before you reach the Lion Rock Fortress on top of Sigiriya. There are several platforms that break up the steps and allow for a little break if you need it. Today Sigiriya rock fortress is one of the most famous Archeological Treasure and UNESCO named Sigiriya rock as a World Heritage in 1982 under the name “Ancient City of Sigiriya Sri Lanka”. </p> <br/><br/>

		 <p class="info">History of Sigiriya Rock Fortress</p>	
          <p> Historical research carried out at the site has brought to light evidence to show that the origins of Sigiriya date back to pre-historic times. Situated at the base of the Sigiriya rock of its eastern side, is a monadnock named Aligala (Elephant Rock). In a cave underneath this, excavation have revealed remains of pre-historic human settlements that existed here around 5,500 years B.P. In addition, there is evidence of human habitation in this area, as far back in history as the 9th — 10th centuries B.C.
          In the 3rd century B.C. a Buddhist monastery had been established at Sigiriya rock fortress. Thirty cave-shelters with drip-ledges, which accommodate monks, have been identified at the base of the great rock so far. In eight of them, details of donations of cave shelters have been inscribed in Brahmi script.
All the principal structures that are found today in Sigiriya, have been erected during the reign of King Kasyapa (A.D. 477 - 495), who chose to make Sigiriya as his seat of administration. According to the eminent archaeologist Prof: Senerath Paranavithana, Sigiriya reflects the sensuousness of a pleasure-loving king, who modeled the city  on  the   mythical   Alakamanda   of god Kuvera. Indian and Roman coins and pottery belonging to the Sassanian dynasty of Persia (Iran) found in Sigiriya rock fortress as well as the affinity to Persian styles in the creation of pleasure gardens all indicate commercial and cultural relations with foreign countries during this brief period.
Subsequently however, in the 6th and 7th centuries A.D., Sigiriya ceased to be of political importance and once again became the abode of Buddhist monks. During this period, the cave-shelters with drip-ledges which belonged to the earlier monastic phase were further improved. Additional shrines such as stupa, image house and bodhi tree shrine were constructed. This second phase of the monastic development continued up to the 12th - 13th centuries A.D.
In the centuries that followed, Sigiriya was totally abandoned, until the 19th century, when it was used as n military out-post of the kings of Kandy. Later, it was a British military. officer, Jonathan Forbes in 1832, who once again brought Sigiriya out of its obscurity, back into historical focus. In 1894, under H.C.P. Bell the Archaeological Department commenced archaeological activities in Sigiriya. Nearly a century later, in 1982, the Central Cultural Fund took over the task, which it continues with great success, to date.</p>
