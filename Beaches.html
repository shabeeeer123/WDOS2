            <h3>SHOWCASE</h3>
            <p>Sri Lanka is a tropical island found in the deep blue waters of the Indian Ocean and the Bay of Bengal. The country is endowed with over a thousand miles of beautiful golden beaches that are fringed with coconut palms making it the ideal destination for a beach holiday. A large percentage of luxurious resorts and villas as well as budget hotels are located along the coastal areas to offer tourists some of the best beach holidays in Sri Lanka. The main attraction for tourists and locals are undoubtedly the beaches but some places like Galle on the South coast consists of historical heritage which is an added advantage to a sun and sand holiday. The drive along the west and south-west coast also offers interesting stopovers such as batik factories or turtle hatcheries, or activities like paying homage at a local temple, sampling local fruits from roadside vendors and getting first-hand knowledge on the art of toddy making.</p>

        <h3>About The Beaches Above</h3>
        <p><strong>1.BENTOTA BEACH</strong><br/>
One of Sri Lankaâ€™s most popular beaches
Arguably one of the most famous seashores of Sri Lanka, the Bentota Beach has long been a favourite of travellers from around the world. Notable for its long stretch of white sand and several safe pockets for wading in the ocean, Bentota Beach is best visited during its season between the months of October and April. The popular coast is also famed for its availability of water sports, ranging from wind-surfing to jet-skiing, and even waterboarding from the waters of the Bentara River.<br/><br/>

<strong>2.MIRISSA BEACH</strong><br/>
Mirissa is a gem of the south coast of Sri Lanka. It's located in a small village between Galle and Matara. 600 meters of shoreline, shaped like a crescent and covered in light pinkish sand, round the ocean, where surfers from all over the world come to.<br/><br/>


<strong>3.UNAWATANA BEACH</strong><br/>
Mihiripenna beach is one of the famous beaches on the south coast at Unawatuna. The beach is perfect if you are on the lookout to spend some quiet and leisure time with your family, away from the buzz of the beach activities. The beach is secluded, and one can spend hours just staring into the beauty of the waves while sitting calmly on the soft golden sand.
